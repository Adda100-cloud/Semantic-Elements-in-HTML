                <h2>Facts about Dogs</h2>
                <p> Dogs have a sense of time but don't understand the 'concept' of time. Unlike humans, dogs don't have the ability to create actual 
                    measures of time, like the second, hour, and minute, and don't know how to read clocks. So telling them "I'll be home in 15 minutes" won't really do much,
                    but we understand that you feel like yoiu have yo do it anyway! Dogs are capable of being trained based on past events, and can be taught to anticipate future
                    events based on past experiences. Pavlov's dogs are the perfect example of this.
